1. Ease to develop
    Excel: very easy
    Tableu: easy, read documents
    D3: complex, need html, css, js, a lot of api to learn
2. Ease to maintain the visualization
    Excel: not easy to maintain
    Tableu: easy to maintain
    D3: good codes make it easy to maintain
3. Usability of visulization developed
    Excel: User can just see some basic charts with no interaction.
    Tableu: User can see many charts and have several basic interactions.
    D3: User can have more different kinds of charts and interactions.
4. Scalability of visualization to “large” datasets
    Excel: It can get very slow and prone to crashing on large datasets.
    Tableu: It’s efficient on large datasets.
    D3: It’s not efficient on large datasets because so many DOM manipulations and some layout algorithms can make it very slow.
5. System requirements to run the visualization
    Excel: OS, software license
    Tableu: OS, software license
    D3: browsers, free
